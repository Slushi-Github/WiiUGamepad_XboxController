# WiiUGamepad_XboxController

This Python script starts a MiiSendU server to let you use the Wii U Gamepad as a Xbox 360 controller!

To use this, you need vgamepad, you get it with ``pip install vgamepad``.
You need the MiiSendU client for the Wii U, I recommend you to [use my fork](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/MiiSendU_Client).
